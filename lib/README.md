The file "pvjs.html" contains an empty HTML template with each of the subcomponents of the diagram viewer and editor, including an SVG template and the controls for typeahead.js, pan-zoom, fullscreen and the annotations panel (details frame).

The directory "shape-library" is part of our library of reusable shapes that can be included in a diagram.

The directory "js" contains several experimental directories and one directory "pvjs" that forms the core of this project.
